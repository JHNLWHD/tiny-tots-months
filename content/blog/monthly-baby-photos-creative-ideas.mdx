# Monthly Baby Photos: Creative Ideas for Capturing Growth

One of the most popular ways to document your baby's first year is through monthly photos. These photos create a beautiful visual timeline showing how much your little one grows and changes. Whether you're a professional photographer or just using your smartphone, here are creative ideas to make your monthly baby photos special.

4. **Capture personality**: Not just growth, but who they are
5. **Don't stress perfection**: Real moments are better than perfect poses

## Documenting Beyond Photos

While photos are wonderful, also consider:
- **Videos**: Capture movement and sounds
- **Notes**: Write about what they're doing that month

Use a comprehensive [milestone tracker](/app) that combines photos, videos, and notes in one place.
